### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at Zhejiang Gongshang University, with a strong interest in distributed systems and cloud-native technologies.
- 🌱 My research focuses on Kubernetes and eBPF, exploring their potential to improve container orchestration, network security, and performance in cloud-native environments.
- 📚 I have published a paper related to these topics in the Telecommunications Science journal, contributing to the knowledge base and sharing insights on innovative solutions in the field.
- 💻 Outside of my research, I enjoy working on open-source projects and learning new programming languages to broaden my skillset.
- 🤝 I'm always open to collaboration on projects related to Kubernetes, eBPF, or other emerging technologies in the cloud-native ecosystem.
- 🌐 You can find my pen-source contributions, and other projects on my GitHub profile.
- 📫 If you're interested in discussing research, collaboration opportunities, or just want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out to me through Email abuxliu@gmail.com.
